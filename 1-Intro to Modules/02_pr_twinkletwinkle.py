# WAP to print twinkle twinkle little star poem.
'''
print("Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.")

'''

'''
If we do it like above then there will be error since there cannot be multiliners that span in more than one line inside print statement. So we need to write them using triple quotes like below
'''

print('''Twinkle twinkle little star.
How I wonder what you are.
Up above the world so high.
Like a diamond in the sky.''')    #Need to be done this way for multiliners inside print statement

'''
THERE MAY ARISE ONE DOUBT OVER HERE!!!
        Previously, triple quote was used for a comment, isnt it? Then, why not here it is being used as comment?
        It is because it acts as comment if it comes alone but here, triple quote is inside the print statement so it is used for printing multiliners spanning in more than one line.
