String is a data type in python. It is a sequence of characters enclosed inside quotes. We can primarily write string in three ways:
1) Single quote : eg. a='Sudip'
2) Double quote : eg. b="Sudip's"
3) Triple quote:  eg. c= ''' '''


2) STRING SLICING

A string in python can be sliced for getting a part of the string.
We will see some examples of string slicing.
