# Sets is a collection of elements inside a curly braces.

# Let us define a set.

set1={1,6,2,"Sudip","Ktm",2}
print(set1)

# From above, we can know that set supports multiple data type of items in it.

# But, we dont get the result as we have typed like above. The sequence gets altered when we try to fetch sets.

# Eg. in above, when we print set1, it is not necessary to get result as we have typed but it may be randomized. The output could be {2,1,"Ktm","Sudip",6} or anyother random sequences. Here, 2 is printed only once but above, 2 is given two times. So, keep in mind that set doesnt support duplicate values.

# Since, the elements inside sets are not arranged in sequential order but randomized, so it is not possible to fetch elements of set like in list and tuple since the indexing of an element is not fixed due to randomization.

# As the set elements are not accesible, so the elements of set cannot be assigned a value too.

# Sets is like list but differences are:
# 1) In sets, the elements are placed in random order each time it is accessed.
# 2) Duplicate values doesnt occur in set.
