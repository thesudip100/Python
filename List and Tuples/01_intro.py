#List is a collection of data separated by comma inside a square bracket and it is printed in ordered form.

# Lets us see how can a liste be created.

a= [1,2,3,4,5]  #creation of list "a"
print(a)  

# Accessing the elements of the list
print(a[0])     # it will print the very first element of the list and similar can be done with indexing starting from 0.

# We can do object assignment in the list unlike strings.eg=
a[2]= 7
a[3]=100
print(a)  # this will print list but this time, instead of 3 at index 2, 7 will be in the list and instead of 4 in index 3, 100 will be printed

# In array, we need to assign the elements of same data type but in list,elemetns of diffeerent data types can also be placed.
# eg=

data= [1,"Sudip",False]
print(data)
