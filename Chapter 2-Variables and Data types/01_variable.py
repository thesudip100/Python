# 2) INTEGER DATA TYPE

b = 367      #integer



# 3) FLOAT DATA TYPE

c = 45.32    #floating point numbers



# Variables are nothing but a container to store a value. Here, a, b, and c are variables which are storing string, integer value and floating point numbers. Python automatically detects the data type of the variable. We dont need to specify the data type in python.

# Data type tells the compiler about the type of variable; either it is float or double or string or anything else.

# Keywords are reserved words in python like def, class, False, True, in, is and,if, elif etc and it is not expected to use these keywords as a variable name.

print(a)
print(w)
print(b)
print(c)



#4)BOOLEANS DATA TYPE(returns either true or false)

d=True
print(d)


#5)NONE DATA TYPES - is used to denote nothing in python

e=None;
print(e);



#PRINTING THE TYPE OF VARIABLE
print(type(b))  #this will print the datatype of variable b.


# IDENTIFIERS are names given to class, function or variables.
